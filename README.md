# fibonacci-sequence

## Instructions:

The Fibonacci Sequence, is a numerical sequence where each number is the sum of the two numbers before it.

Eg. 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 are the first eight digits in the sequence.

[] Using iteration, write a function fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the Fibonacci sequence.

[] Using an example input of 8, this function should return the array [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].

[] Now write another function fibsRec which solves the same problem recursively.

[] Test both versions of your functions by passing in various lengths as arguments.

## Notes and Resources:

Run code in the terminal by using the following CLI command:

`node <filename.js>`
